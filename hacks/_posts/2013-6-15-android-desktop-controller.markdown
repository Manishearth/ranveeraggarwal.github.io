Made as an Institute Technical Summer Project (ITSP), Android Desktop Controller is an Android application that (as is apparent from the name) let's you access your PC through your mobile. It works on both Windows and Linux, with a background Java application on the PC that gets control strings from the Android phone via **Bluetooth** and then accordingly they are interpreted as commands.

Current Status:

* Currently, the application supports only keyboard commands from the mobile device
* The Java desktop application isn't a compiled executable. It needs to be compiled for use.
